I’m Abel Vidal, a Platform Engineering Manager passionate about building reliable, scalable, and empowering technology foundations for teams and organizations.</p><h2 id=my-journey>My Journey</h2><p>With a background in software engineering and years of experience leading platform and infrastructure teams, I’ve had the privilege of working with talented engineers to design, implement, and evolve platforms that enable product teams to deliver value faster and with confidence. My career has taken me through various roles, from hands-on development to technical leadership, always with a focus on automation, developer experience, and operational excellence.</p><h2 id=leadership-philosophy>Leadership Philosophy</h2><p>I believe in servant leadership: my role is to remove obstacles, foster growth, and create an environment where engineers can do their best work. I value transparency, continuous learning, and collaboration. I’m convinced that a strong platform is not just about technology, but about people, processes, and culture.</p><h2 id=platform-vision>Platform Vision</h2><p>My goal is to build platforms that are robust yet flexible, secure yet user-friendly. I’m passionate about infrastructure as code, cloud-native technologies, and empowering teams through self-service and automation. I strive to bridge the gap between development and operations, making sure our platforms are enablers, not bottlenecks.</p><h2 id=beyond-work>Beyond Work</h2><p>Outside of work, I enjoy sharing knowledge through writing and mentoring.</p><h2 id=lets-connect>Let’s Connect</h2><p>If you want to know more about my professional background, feel free to visit my <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/abelgv/>LinkedIn profile</a>.</p></div></article></main></div><footer><span></span></footer></body></html>
