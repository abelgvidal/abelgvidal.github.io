A group of doctors received this question:</p><blockquote><p>The test of a disease has a 5% false positive rate. The disease affects 1 in 1000 people in the population. People are tested randomly, whether they are suspected to be sick or not. A particular patient&rsquo;s test is positive. What is the probability that this patient actually has the disease?</p></blockquote><p>Most doctors said 95%. The correct answer is closer to 2%.</p><h2 id=an-intuitive-approach>An Intuitive Approach</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s break this down step by step. Imagine you have a machine (the test) to find sick people in a village of 1000 inhabitants:</p><ol><li>In this village, only 1 person is actually sick (1 in 1000)</li><li>The machine makes mistakes: for every 100 healthy people it tests, it gets it wrong with 5 and says they&rsquo;re sick when they&rsquo;re not (5% false positive rate)</li></ol><p>Out of the 1000 people in the village:</p><ul><li>1 person is actually sick</li><li>999 people are healthy</li></ul><p>Of the 999 healthy people:</p><ul><li>The machine gets it wrong with 5% of them</li><li>5% of 999 ≈ 50 people</li><li>This means the machine will say 50 healthy people are sick</li></ul><p>So, when the test returns a positive result:</p><ul><li>It could be the 1 person who is actually sick</li><li>Or it could be one of the 50 healthy people the machine got wrong about</li></ul><p>So only 1 among 51 positives is really sick. Probability ≈ 2%</p><h2 id=why-did-the-doctors-get-it-wrong>Why Did the Doctors Get It Wrong?</h2><p>The doctors&rsquo; intuitive answer of 95% was wrong because they focused only on the test&rsquo;s accuracy for a single case. They failed to consider:</p><ol><li>The base rate (how rare the disease is)</li><li>How the false positive rate affects a large population of healthy people</li><li>How these factors combine using Bayes&rsquo; Theorem</li></ol><p>This is known as the base rate fallacy or base rate neglect, and it&rsquo;s a common cognitive bias that affects all of us.</p><h2 id=more>More</h2><ul><li>Tversky, A., & Kahneman, D.
