Este proceso ocurre cuando Kubernetes elimina un pod, ya sea por una actualización de un Deployment, un escalado, un eviction por falta de recursos, o cuando el usuario elimina manualmente el pod. Comprender cómo funciona la terminación elegante ayuda a diseñar aplicaciones más robustas.</description></item><item><title>Mucho Ruido y Cuatro Plataformas</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/2025-12-15-4platforms/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Dec 2025 09:03:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/2025-12-15-4platforms/</guid><description>Hay cuatro tipos de plataformas:
Marketplaces: son sitios que permiten a dos partes hacer transacciones.
Ejemplos reales: Wallapop eBay Airbnb Plataformas base: dotan de recursos IT para empezar un proyecto.
Ejemplos reales: Amazon Web Services (AWS) Microsoft Azure Google Cloud Platform Plataformas de desarrollo: permiten desarrollar mejor y más rápido.

Nobody Informed the Brain.</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/2025-12-14-metabolic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:03:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/2025-12-14-metabolic/</guid><description>Metabolism is about converting food into energy, and it does so through three main pathways:
the glucose pathway: the body processes carbohydrates and produces energy. This is the priority pathway for the brain and red blood cells—the former because of its importance, and the latter because they have no mitochondria.
the beta-oxidation pathway: it transforms fat into energy. When insulin drops, this pathway increases.
the ketosis pathway: it allows the energy from beta-oxidation to be distributed throughout the body in a context of low glucose.</description></item><item><title>I Used to Make My Own Omega-3. I Still Don't.</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/omega3-6ev/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Dec 2025 09:03:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/omega3-6ev/</guid><description>We call Omega-3 and Omega-6 “essential fatty acids” because the body cannot produce them and needs to obtain them through food. One might ask why, if it’s such an essential element, evolution didn’t favor the selection of individuals capable of synthesizing it, but the way to think about it is the inverse: humans anciently had the capacity to synthesize it but precisely due to economy stopped doing so, optimized to obtain it from the environment where it was abundant at the time, and focused its investment on other more advantageous things.</description></item><item><title>ῥοή: On the Conversational Nature of Reality.</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/2025-11-18-rhoe/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 10:10:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/2025-11-18-rhoe/</guid><description>David Whyte —marine biologist, poet, and philosopher (boom!)— has written about a concept that caught my attention: the conversational nature of reality. The idea is surprisingly intuitive: reality isn’t a solid block you push against in a single direction. It’s a series of exchanges in which you give and receive, and each interaction reshapes the world. Reality isn’t a problem waiting for a final solution, but a conversation that gradually reveals itself.</description></item><item><title>Use tailscale to protect a personal website</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/use-tailscale-for-personal-web/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 20:02:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/use-tailscale-for-personal-web/</guid><description>How to use tailscale to protect a personal website …</description></item><item><title>Hugo: filter post by tag</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/filter-tags-in-hugo-template/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 20:02:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/filter-tags-in-hugo-template/</guid><description>I wanted to stop showing in the frontpage of this blog powered by (Hugo) the posts tagged as “TIL” or “IWL”.

This book is special because it contrasts Zen teachings with 1950s consumer America.
We meet Franny Glass, a young woman who belongs to a family of gifted intellectuals. She feels overwhelmed by life’s superficiality and seeks answers in spirituality. The story is divided into two parts showing important moments in the lives of Franny and her brother Zooey.
A note about the author: Salinger was transformed by his experience in World War II, where he participated in D-Day and witnessed the horrors of concentration camps.</description></item><item><title>Knight trap in the Petrov Defense</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/knight-petrov/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2025 00:03:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/knight-petrov/</guid><description>Knight trap in the Petrov Defense As an improving chess player, I’m always excited when I can execute a clean tactical sequence.

The thesis of the book is that when we look at the past we find things that are not there, the past is much more random than our vision. This is called the Hindsight bias. So we have to be aware that when people relate the past usually they tend to create post-hoc rationalizations and retrofitted explanations.</description></item><item><title>AI Eats Its Own Tail</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/eatitself/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:03:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/eatitself/</guid><description>Seeing the evolution of StackOverflow, which seems to be declining due to the rise of ChatGPT and similar tools, I wonder about the long-term viability of projects like this.
On the other hand, where will AIs get their information if these projects disappear? Their answers could degrade significantly without such resources.
Could we be stuck in a cycle where AI destroys these collaborative platforms, worsens after losing them, then these platforms revive because this is information that is needed (and now is missing), only to decline again as AI uses their information to present it in a more convenient way?</description></item><item><title>Be wrong in Probability Like a Pro</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/optionalrandom/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jan 2025 20:03:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/optionalrandom/</guid><description>In her book “Randomness,” Deborah Bennett presents an example that illustrates how bad we are at calculating probabilities, even highly trained professionals. A group of doctors received this question:
The test of a disease has a 5% false positive rate. The disease affects 1 in 1000 people in the population. People are tested randomly, whether they are suspected to be sick or not. A particular patient’s test is positive. What is the probability that this patient actually has the disease?</description></item><item><title>Why 'type type type type' runs three times in Bash</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/recursive-bash/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2025 20:03:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/recursive-bash/</guid><description>In Bash, when we run the command type type type type, we observe a peculiar behavior: it executes three times instead of once or four times. This phenomenon is fascinating and is due to how Bash processes arguments and how the type command specifically works.
The behavior of type The type command is a Bash builtin used to determine how Bash would interpret a command name. When we execute:

The Engineering Profession Different sociological perspectives explore the meaning of professions, from traditional occupations like doctors or lawyers to modern professions requiring university education. The fundamental aspect of a profession is its unique service to society, a vocation that has intensified with modernity through “professionalization.”
There are notable concerns about the excesses of this process, such as the obsession with titles rather than service to society, distinguishing between “bad professionalism” and “good professionalism” oriented toward the community.</description></item><item><title>Making Obsidian Talk with Google's Fancy Wavenet Voices</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/obsidian-wavenet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Dec 2024 20:03:54 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/obsidian-wavenet/</guid><description>I’m sharing a little hack I put together. As a hardcore Obsidian user, I was getting frustrated with the available text-to-speech options. I really wanted to use Google’s Wavenet voices because they sound amazing, but couldn’t find a plugin that did exactly what I wanted. So I sorted it out myself.
I cobbled together a hack using Google Cloud’s Text-to-Speech API and Obsidian’s Shell Commands plugin. Here’s how you can do it too (assuming you’re on Linux, if not you need some adjustment):</description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/aboutme/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.lpsz.org/posts/aboutme/</guid><description>Hi!
