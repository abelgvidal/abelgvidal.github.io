          <title>Reading notes: Ethics for Engineering</title>

          <description>These are my reading notes for the book ‚Äú√âtica para ingenieros‚Äù by Galo Bilbao Alberdi, Francisco Javier Fuertes P√©rez and Jos√© M¬™ Guibert Uc√≠n.
The Engineering Profession Different sociological perspectives explore the meaning of professions, from traditional occupations like doctors or lawyers to modern professions requiring university education. The fundamental aspect of a profession is its unique service to society, a vocation that has intensified with modernity through ‚Äúprofessionalization.‚Äù
There are notable concerns about the excesses of this process, such as the obsession with titles rather than service to society, distinguishing between ‚Äúbad professionalism‚Äù and ‚Äúgood professionalism‚Äù oriented toward the community.</description>

          <description>I‚Äôm sharing a little hack I put together. As a hardcore Obsidian user, I was getting frustrated with the available text-to-speech options. I really wanted to use Google‚Äôs Wavenet voices because they sound amazing, but couldn‚Äôt find a plugin that did exactly what I wanted. So I sorted it out myself.
I cobbled together a hack using Google Cloud‚Äôs Text-to-Speech API and Obsidian‚Äôs Shell Commands plugin. Here‚Äôs how you can do it too (assuming you‚Äôre on Linux, if not you need some adjustment):</description>

          <description>Recursion in Bash Recursion in Bash commands can be useful, especially in debugging and understanding how the shell interprets inputs. This guide focuses on recursive commands like type, eval, and builtin and compares them with non-recursive ones like ls and echo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.
What is Recursion in Bash? Some Bash commands call themselves when processing their inputs. For example, type can take itself as an argument and repeatedly resolve its behavior until it provides a final answer.</description>
