          <title>AI Eats Its Own Tail</title>

          <description>Seeing the evolution of StackOverflow, which seems to be declining due to the rise of ChatGPT and similar tools, I wonder about the long-term viability of projects like this.
On the other hand, where will AIs get their information if these projects disappear? Their answers could degrade significantly without such resources.
Could we be stuck in a cycle where AI destroys these collaborative platforms, worsens after losing them, then these platforms revive because this is information that is needed (and now is missing), only to decline again as AI uses their information to present it in a more convenient way?</description>

          <title>Why &#39;type type type type&#39; runs three times in Bash</title>

          <description>In Bash, when we run the command type type type type, we observe a peculiar behavior: it executes three times instead of once or four times. This phenomenon is fascinating and is due to how Bash processes arguments and how the type command specifically works.
The behavior of type The type command is a Bash builtin used to determine how Bash would interpret a command name. When we execute:
type type type type We get an output similar to this:</description>

          <title>Reading notes: Ethics for Engineering</title>

          <description>These are my reading notes for the book ‚Äú√âtica para ingenieros‚Äù by Galo Bilbao Alberdi, Francisco Javier Fuertes P√©rez and Jos√© M¬™ Guibert Uc√≠n.
The Engineering Profession Different sociological perspectives explore the meaning of professions, from traditional occupations like doctors or lawyers to modern professions requiring university education. The fundamental aspect of a profession is its unique service to society, a vocation that has intensified with modernity through ‚Äúprofessionalization.‚Äù
There are notable concerns about the excesses of this process, such as the obsession with titles rather than service to society, distinguishing between ‚Äúbad professionalism‚Äù and ‚Äúgood professionalism‚Äù oriented toward the community.</description>

          <title>Making Obsidian Talk with Google&#39;s Fancy Wavenet Voices</title>

          <description>I‚Äôm sharing a little hack I put together. As a hardcore Obsidian user, I was getting frustrated with the available text-to-speech options. I really wanted to use Google‚Äôs Wavenet voices because they sound amazing, but couldn‚Äôt find a plugin that did exactly what I wanted. So I sorted it out myself.
I cobbled together a hack using Google Cloud‚Äôs Text-to-Speech API and Obsidian‚Äôs Shell Commands plugin. Here‚Äôs how you can do it too (assuming you‚Äôre on Linux, if not you need some adjustment):</description>

          <description>How to Misinterpret Probabilities Like a Pro ‚ÄúWe made too many wrong mistakes‚Äù. Yogi Berra.
In her book ‚ÄúRandomness,‚Äù Deborah Bennett presents a fascinating example that illustrates how bad we are at calculating probabilities, even highly trained professionals. A group of doctors received this question:
The test of a disease has a 5% false positive rate. The disease affects 1 in 1000 people in the population. People are tested randomly, whether they are suspected to be sick or not.</description>
